## Features

### MDX

The MDX files for blog posts and project details are fetched from another GitHub repository using the GitHub API.

### Admin

Protected route with next-auth credentials for managing the DB. The tables are rendered on dedicated routes, with sort and filter functionality.

The forms are validated using react-hook-form and Zod.

All CRUD operations use server actions.

### Modals

The admin forms use [Intercepting Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes) with [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) to show a modal on top of the current page.
